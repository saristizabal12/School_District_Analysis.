Analyze Data on student funding - aggregate data 

#Overview of the school district analysis:
For the assignment we analyzed the districts school system using key metrics in order to budget out what each school should have according by their the number of students and grade. 
1. First, we made sure to clean out any NaN data or data that was missing in order to prevent any misinformation of our data sets. 
2. Next, we organized the data so we can facilitate the process of review and take out any potential outliers that would create any discrepancies. 
3. After we generated a summary and potential budgets for the school. 
4. Finally, we created the spending range and the data types using our key metrics in and organized the DataFrames to provide visualize the information when we would have to propose the final budgets.

Challenge Summary
When we removed the 9th grade passing from Thomas High we noticed that there was a significant change from 91% to 65% passing rate. Replaceing these grades will have a great impact on the school since they could fall into the category of low funding if we didn't include the 9th grade.
